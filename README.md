Rapid Tanks


* Overview
Rapid Tanks is a GUI application that supports calculating emissions from tanks based on the EPA AP 42 Chapter 7 regulations. The current suite of products that can acomplish this are either incorrect based on updated regulations (TANKS 4.09d) or are only avaliable at significant cost (TankESP). An open-source implementation of the emissions calculations will hopefully drive costs down and increase compliance with the Chapter 7 regulations.
